            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>REAT is the variety of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in this our age, and great is the contention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the truth therof.

                  <p>This buſines, notwithſtanding, is moſt worthy of great deliberation and diſcuſſion, ſeeing that heerin conſiſteth the very center of our ſaluation. Euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſaluation or damnation is no ſmall matter; but euen ſuch, as all other things, be they good or bad, are nothing in compariſon therof. And this damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſaluation dependeth of good or bad Religion. If thy Religion be good, it ſhall be eaſy for thee to obtaine ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but if it be euill, it is impoſſible for thee to be ſaued. By euill or falſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion thou canſt not pleaſe God,

                  <p>Furthermore, true Religion is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one, and not manifold; for that there is but one verity, one faith,

No man in this religion can once find in his hart to imitate an Angelicall life heere in this world, as many holy men haue done before, and many do at this preſent in the Catholike Church: no man goeth about to ſhake of the carkes and cares of this life, breaking in pieces

                     <p>Who then ſeeth not, that in theſe there is no Chriſtian religion?

Nay rather thoſe men do greatly iniure Chriſt, becauſe they take away this force and efficacy from him: like vnto certaine Philoſophers, who taught that things created had no force in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to cooperate, but that the only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created power of God did al, and therby iniured his Omnipotency, as if he could not giue force to things created to worke &amp; cooperate with God. For as he ſhould iniure Chriſt, that ſhould attribute to man any force or ſtrength to merit, that is not deriued from the merits of Chriſt: ſo alſo ſhould he iniure God, that ſhould attribute any force or power to things created that is not deriued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency of God. Furthermore as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of things created are referred vnto God, as the Author of all, becauſe he gaue them force, and togeather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth with them as the vniuerſall efficient cauſe: euen ſo are all the meritts of iuſt men referred vnto Chriſt, as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of them all, becauſe he gaue them force and power therto, and togeather
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:5297:17"/>concurreth with them as the vniuerſall meritorious cauſe. I omit many other things which might be brought to this purpoſe.</p>

                     <head>II. CONSIDERATION. <hi>That Christian Religion excludeth liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſinning.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THAT Religion is alſo to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, as moſt gratefull to God, which alloweth no liberty of ſinning but by all meanes excludeth it. For as the Religion which is of God ought to ſtir vp and incite mens mindes to the ſtudy of good workes, and perfection of Chriſtian life: euen ſo ought it alſo to feare them from ſynning, keep them in the feare of God, and, as much as in it lieth, hinder all ſynnes and offences. Such then is the Catholike Religion. For many wayes doth ſhe remoue al li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of ſinning</p>
                     <p>Firſt, by the Sacrament of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: For that it greatly feareth very many from ſynning, ſeing they know that all their ſynnes muſt be diſcouered
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:5297:18"/>one by one in Confeſſion, and Pennance done accordingly; and if any thing be ſtoine, or any loſſe or domage done, the ſame muſt be reſtored, and ſatisfaction made. Moreouer in this Sacrament is required ſorrow for their ſyns, and purpoſe to amend their life: wherunto is alſo conferred grace and aide to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the ſame: and laſt of all heerin are giuen wholſome admonitions to liue well and vprightly. Wherby we ſee, that this Sacrament doth greatly reſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neliberty of ſynning.</p>
                     <p>Secondly by the doctrine of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction &amp; Purgatory. For it teacheth that after the ſyn and eternall payne is forgiuen (in Confeſſion) there remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth for the moſt part an obligation of ſome great temporall payne, which vnleſſe we redeeme in this life by the exerciſe of good workes, to wit by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, almes, abſtinence, and the like; we ſhall pay it in the next life, with the cruel torments of Purgatory. For that with God no euill ſhall remayne vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, for that it teacheth, that one only mortall ſinne vnleſſe it be waſhed
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:5297:18"/>away in this life by Pennance, is inough to euerlaſting Damnation: neyther ſhall faith any thing profit to the forgiuenes of ſynnes, without true pennance.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, for that it many wayes ſtriketh into man the feare of God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing vnto him diuers of his iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts; when as he wil neuer haue him ſecure of his ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but alwayes to watch, pray, to be ſober, to be alwayes intent to do good workes, leaſt at any time he be ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ouercome by tentation or ſuppla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted through the fraud of the Diuell, or fall by ſome in conſideration, or els not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, ſuddainly ſurprized with vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected death. And hence it is, that in good Catholikes, who endeauour to liue according to their Religion, we dayly ſee a wonderfull care and ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in auoyding of ſynne: &amp; if through humane frailty, they ſhall at any tyme commit any offence, they ſtraight waies waſh it away with Confeſſion, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of their liues.</p>
                     <p>Now, other Religions do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme no ſuch thing at all, but ſhaking of all feare of God, open the wyde gate to all liberty of ſynne and licentiouſnes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:5297:19"/>Firſt, becauſe <hi>they take away the Sacrament of Confeſſion,</hi> wherby men, as we haue ſaid, are greatly hindred from ſynning.
<note place="margin">Heretiks take away all feare of God, and admit all liberty of ſynning.</note> For that they ſay, it is an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inuention, a torment of mens Conſciences, and a meere ſuperſtition. It is a wonderfull thing, that any ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, or inuention of mens brayne ſhould haue ſuch force to the amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of our life &amp; quietting of our Conſciences! This force alſo haue the <hi>Lutherans</hi> themſelues, being taught by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, ſometymes witneſſed. For as <hi>Sotus</hi> relateth, who was preſent, that when the Emperour <hi>(Charles the fifth)</hi> was in Germany,
<note place="margin">

This embaſſage, ſaith <hi>Sotus,</hi> cauſed great laughter. For if
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:5297:19"/>by Diuine law men were not bound to reueale their ſecret ſynnes to any, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could the Prieſt, as they thought, abſolue them: how could they be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled therunto by any humane precept, without fruites of remiſſion of their ſynnes.</p>

                     <p>Seauenthly, <hi>becauſe they teach, that no ſin shalbe imputed vnto him that hath a liuely faith.</hi> And for this reaſon <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid, that the Commandements did no more belong to vs, then the cerimonies of the old law, but that all obligation therof was taken away at once by Chriſt, to wit, becauſe the violating therof is no leſſe imputed to the faithfull, then the violating of the cerimoniall law. That al theſe things are thus taught by them, is manifeſt by the places here cited in the margent; and euery man that is but mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nay, there is as much or rather more liberty giuen by theſe Religions, as by Atheiſme. For if there be no ſyn impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a man that hath that forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſpeciall or liuely faith, eyther for

Neyther: for by liuely faith alone, no ſyn ſhalbe imputed to any man, although it be neuer ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous and filthy. What then? Shall he feare the Diuine wrath, or the ſubtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heauenly Grace? No: for that God doth not impute the ſame vnto him: and for the ſatisfaction that Chriſt made, he cannot be offended with him. Doth he feare temporall ſatisfaction, or Confeſſion? Neyther: For that theſe things are taken away as ſuperſtitions. What then doth this man more feare then any Atheiſt? Or how doth he not open as wyde a gate to all wickednes &amp; impurity as the Atheiſt? What Atheiſme teacheth, the Scripture witneſſeth, when ſhe fayth: <hi>The foole ſaid in hic hart,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Pſal.</hi> 13.</note> there is no God: they are corrupt, and are made abhominable in all their endeauours: There is not one that doth good, there is not ſo much as one.</hi> And this doth Atheiſme teach, for ſo much as it taketh away the feare of Diuine puniſhment, wherby men are held as with a bridle from ſynning. But theſe Religions do
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:5297:21"/>no leſſe take a way the feare of heauenly reueng and chaſtiſement, when as they teach, that noſyn ſhalbe imputed, eyther for offence or payne, nor any man pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed therfore.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer I ſay, that by theſe Religions, this wholſome feare of God, is ſooner taken a way then by Atheiſme. For few Atheiſts do certainly belieue, that there is not any God at al; but many doubt it, and feare the contrary, and ſo they be not without feare of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him,
<note place="margin">They take away all feare of God foure manner of wayes.</note> that may in many things repreſſe them. But theſe Religions do for certaine &amp; without all doubt teach, that ſynnes are not imputed to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and this they commaund to be moſt firmely belieued; and therfore they leaue no feare, but do ſhake of all ſuſpition &amp; imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of puniſhment whatſoeuer: ſo, as they giue a far greater ſcope to all wickednes, then Atheiſme doth. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they this by one manner of way only, but by a fourefold.</p>
                     <p>Firſt: For that they teach, <hi>that through ſaith ſynnes are not imputed vnto vs, be they neuey ſo many, or neuer ſo heynow;</hi> wherof we haue ſpoken inough before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:5297:21"/>Secondly: For that they ſay, <hi>that all thoſe who haue true faith are predeſtinated,

For neyther can they doubt of their ſaluation, or that they ſhall go to hell; becauſe Gods predeſtination is potent and immutable, and thoſe who are ſo predeſtinated cannot poſſibly periſh. Neyther can they feare the paynes of Purgatory, which they beleeue not: nor yet can they feare puniſhments in this life, when as ſynnes are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them by God.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly: <hi>For that they take away the liberty of Freewill,</hi> and do teach,

                        <hi>that all things happen by an ineuitable neceſſity;</hi> and <hi>that a man ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not make his works better or worſe.</hi> For if there be no liberty, there is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly no ſinne: like as a lyon when he demoureth a man, although he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth euill, yet ſinneth not; becauſe he doth it not freely, but by the vehement
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:5297:22"/>inſtigation of nature; nor is it in his power to moderate this his inſtigation. Noe man ſhall be then worthy of puniſhment, becauſe that which is done by force of neceſſity, deſerueth no puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhment: Wherefore there ſhalbe no hell nor any puniſhment at all after this life. For that it ſhould be a great and intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable cruelty to damne a man to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting torments for thoſe things which by no meanes he could auoid. Wherfore then ſhould they feare to follow their harts deſire, or do any thing that may pleaſe their appetite?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly: For that they teach, <hi>all mens workes,

For that God is not the reuenger of that wherof he is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, nor can he puniſh that which he will haue done in vs, and cauſeth vs to do. For that this ſhould be more then Tyrannicall cruelty, from which God

                     <p>Here by then it is as cleare as the funne, that theſe Religions, by theſe foure wayes now declared, do take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the minds of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all feare of God, &amp; do giue as large a ſcope to all wickednes, as euer any Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme in the world: and that the more perniciouſly, becauſe the are not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in the open view and ſhew of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, but vnder the colour (forſooth) of diuine religion and honour, to wit, vnder the faire titles of only faith, ſatif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Chriſt, liberty of the new Ghoſpell, diuine prouidence, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination.

                     <p>Fourthly: It is altogeather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible that God ſhould permit men ſo innocent, ſo contemning themſelues and worldly affaires, ſo ſtudious of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine glory, and ardent louers of him, to be deceiued for ſo many ages, in a matter of ſo great moment, to witt, in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines of religion and foundation of all piety.

For that a good ſpirit can neuer be without a good Religion. I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:5297:25"/>many other things which might be brought for confirmation heerof.</p>
                     <p>But if it be blaſphemy to ſay, that diuine promiſes be falſe, then is it neceſſary to confeſſe, that theſe men did receiue the true faith and Religion-Wherfore, ſeing that they imbraced the Catholike Religion, and were moſt addicted to the Roman Church, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting and hating all other faith and Religion that was contrary to this; it cannot be doubted, but that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and Roman is the only true, and heauenly inſpired Religion. And all Religions beſides, are falſe and inuented by the Diuell.</p>
                     <p>Finally, if their Religion were not the true, but rather ſome of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaryes the true Religion; then is it neceſſary to confeſſe, all the forſaid men, whome the whole world hath held for Saintes, not to haue byn not only holy men, and friends to God, but to haue byn impious and enemyes to him, and ſo damned and adiugded to euerlaſting puniſhments. For without true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it is impoſſible to pleaſe God. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be ſaid, that they were to be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:5297:26"/>excuſed by ignorance: for that ignorance doth not excuſe, except in certayne ſecondary caſes, which by reaſon of ſome poſitiue precept are neceſſary; but in no caſe doth it excuſe in any fundamentall and chiefehead. For otherwiſe any man may obtayne ſaluation without any knowledg of God or Chriſt at al, which is repugnant to al Scripture. But if theſe men erred (as ſome of our Aduerſaryes do pretend that they did) then erred they in the chiefe heads.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged not a ſpeciall faith, wherby only we are iuſtified and made partaker of the redemption and iuſtice of Chriſt, and ſinne is not imputed vnto vs, as the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of other Religions do teach: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they remained in ſinne, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of the participation of the Iuſtice of Chriſt, &amp; conſequently were childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Hell.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe according to their judgment they were out of the true Church of Chriſt (out of which, by conſent of all, there is no ſaluation) &amp; did adhere to the whore of Babylon (for ſo do they call the Roman Church) and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:5297:26"/>were the chiefe miniſters &amp; inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, becauſe they were Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latours, adoring a creature for their Creatour, to wit bread and wyne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed of Chriſtin the Euchariſt, worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Saintes &amp; their Images &amp;c. Theſe thinges may not be excuſed by any ignorance whatſoeuer. And therfore all theſe were wicked men, and adiudged to hell torments. But how improbable, and incredible are all theſe things, and againſt the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon conſent of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian men that euer were? And on the contrary ſide, in other Religions there were neuer any of famous ſanctity, nor can they name ſo much as one. For that their very firſt Authors were giuen to temporall commodities, and were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of pleaſures; hauing nothing ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular in their liues aboue the common ſort of people, but rather giuen to greater vices and wickednes. But of this point we ſhall ſpeake more heereafter.</p>
                     <p>Nor doth it any way preiudice our cauſe, that among Catholikes, there be many who do not only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>es of life is not any way to be imputed to their religion, nor doth it argue the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection thereof. For whereas there be three things wherby to reuoke men from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting euill, and to incite them to do good, to wit, feare of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hope of Reward, and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency it ſelfe of the good worke wroght; the Catholik Religion doth moſt highly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend, propoſe and inculcare the ſame to her followers; omitting nothing wherby to ſtir them vp to auoyd ſinne and follow vertu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. And if perchance ſome of them do not aſpire or attayne heerto, that is not to be imputed to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Religion, but to the liberty of their owne free will which ſtriueth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all theſe former incitements: But if the ſaid Catholike Religion ſhould
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:5297:27"/>take away all feare of puniſhment, and hope of reward, eſteeming all her good workes to be ſtayned and defiled with ſynne, then might the wicked life of men, and their neglect of good workes be worthily imputed and laid vnto her charge. For euen as he that ſhould take away a proppe from a houſe that were ready to fall, ſhould be the cauſe of the fall of that houſe: So he that ſhould take away the feare of God, and of future puniſhments, wherby men are kept in awe from falling into the pit of ſynne, ſhould be the cauſe of theſe ruines and miſeries. And in like manner he that ſhould take away that which is wont to incite men to the ſtudy of good workes, ſhould be the cauſe of their neglect and contempt of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Wherby it is manifeſt, that euill life and neglect of good workes, which is found in ſome Catholikes, is not to be imputed to their Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but to the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty only of their freewill: Wheras the ſame notwithſtanding amongſt Lutherans, Caluiniſtes, and other followers of new Religions is properly imputed and laid vpon their Religion, which taketh

                        </gap>hinke that theſe men excelling in ſanctity, learning, &amp; authority, would to the deſtruction of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:5297:29"/>their ſoules, &amp; to the euerlaſting infamy of their names, feygne theſe miracles, therby to beguile the world? For that a lye in thoſe things which belong to Religion, is a moſt pernicious and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſynne. Againe: yf theſe miracles were feigned, they might eaſily haue byn conuinced and refuted of vanity by men of thoſe ages, amongſt whome they were ſaid to haue byn wrought: But neuer yet did any man reiect the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, except he were a Pagan, a Iew, or an Heretike. Moreouer very many of theſe miracles haue byn confirmed by publike teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Biſhops or Magiſtrates, who with mature diligence and deliberatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> examined the cauſes therof. Finally, to ſay that they were feigned is to take away all credit of hiſtoryes, and to ouerthrow all knowledge of former tymes: for that it may be aſwell ſaid of all things anciently done, that they were feigned, when as they cannot otherwiſe be proued, then by the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and teſtimony of Authors.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, that theſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were not wrought by the help of the Diuell, is manifeſt many wayes.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:5297:30"/>Firſt, becauſe they were done by moſt holy men, and ſuch as were moſt intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall with God. For who will thinke that <hi>S. Francis, S. Dominick, S. Bernard, S. Benet, S. Martin,</hi> and their like had any familiar conuerſation with the Diuell?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe theſe miracles did far ſurpaſſe the Diuels power: for that the Diuell cannot giue ſight to the blind, cure the lame, raiſe vp the dead, ſuddainly ſtreng then ſicke of the palſey, in a moment quicken dry and benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med members, and the like, which do exceed all force of nature. Neyther could any Magitian euer do the ſame by any help or art of the Diuell; and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding very many and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſuch like did our Saintes worke, and that by only touching, or a few prayers, or the ſigne of the Croſſe, and ſometymes alſo by a commaund only.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, becauſe thoſe miracles that be wrought by the Diuell, do eyther continue but for a ſmall eyme, as being decoyts and deluſions only of the eyes, ſuch as nagitians are wont to do; or if they do continue, they are wrought by
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:5297:30"/>naturall cauſes, &amp; ſo do not exceed their naturall force and power. Beſides ſuch falſe miracles are for the moſt part not only vnprofitable to men, but hurtfull alſo and wicked: as for example, to make fire deſcend from heauen, to make ſtatua', ſpeake, and the like, which Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt &amp; his falſe prophets ſhall do in the laſt dayes, as out of the Apocalyps is gathered;
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13.</note> neyther do theſe falſe miracles profit any to the amendment of life. But the miracles of Saintes haue a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and ſolid operation, and are very profitable to men, ſtyrring them vp to the feare of God, and the amendment of their liues.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, New miracles were neuer approued in the Catholike Church without great and diligent examination therof before made: for that the witneſſes are examined, and that for the moſt part vnder their Oaths; the fact it ſelfe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> narrowly looked into, whether it may be wrought by the force of Nature, or power of the Diuell: all circumſtances are conſidered, by what meanes, order, what occaſion, what tyme &amp; place, to what end, before
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:5297:31"/>whome, and vpon whome the miracle is wrought. And oftentymes there want not thoſe, who would willingly exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerate the matter, or els make it doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſuſpected, if they could, and therfore they leaue nothing vntryed or diſcuſſed. So as it is impoſſible, that the deceyt, if any be, can longly hidden; beſides it doth belong to the diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God not to permit men to be ſo miſerably deluded, eſpecially after ſo great diligence vſed, to ſearch out the truth of the matter.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly: Yf the miracles of the Catholick Church be wrought by the Diuell to retayne men in their falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; why doth he not the like then in other Religions, to wit, among the Turkes, Arians, Anabaptiſtes, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, and the like? Why doth he leaue to worke miracles amongſt theſe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth famous only Catholike Religion therewith? Is it for that perhaps ſhe is more grateful or pleaſing vnto him then all the reſt? but he ought not to neglect others alſo, from whome he receyueth ſo large and ample increaſe: he is deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with variety of falſe worſhip, that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:5297:31"/>he may accomodate himſelfe to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and affections of all men. Therfore ſeing that only Catholike Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion hath myracles, and falſe Religion hath none; it is an euident token that the miracles of the Catholike Church are not wrought by the Diuell.</p>
                     <p>Finally, what colour of reaſon can there be, to ſay, that theſe miracles ſhould be feigned, or wrought by the Diuell? Is it becauſe they could not be otherwiſe done? But God is omnipotent and he hath wrought many the like by his Apoſtles, as out of Scripture is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt. Or is it becauſe they be repugnant to Scripture? But our Lord hath plainly promiſed this grace of working miracles and curing, when he ſaid:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ioan.</hi> 14.</note> 
                        <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, verily. I ſay vnto you, be that belieueth in me, the workes that I do, he alſo shall do, and greater then theſe shall he do, becauſe I go to my Father; and whatſoeuer you shall aske in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the ſonne.</hi> By which wordes he inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that the grace of working miracles ſhould alwaies remaine in the Church, and that not the Apoſtles alone, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Apoſtolicall &amp; holy men alſo ſhould
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:5297:32"/>from time to time worke miracles: ſo as we ſee this promiſe of our Lord fulfilled, when Holy men do miracles.</p>
                     <p>Or is it then, becauſe there is no witnes of theſe miracles? But beſides the witnes of moſt faithfull wryters, we haue the teſtimony and conſent of the people: we haue in many of them the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of Biſhops or Magiſtrates after moſt diligent examination made of the thing it ſelfe, and depoſition of ſworne witneſſes. Beſides that, very many of theſe miracles haue bin publikely done in the preſence of many people; &amp; there are no ancient hiſtories extant (beſides thoſe that are conteined in holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) that haue ſo many and worthy witneſſes for their truth, as theſe of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles haue. To theſe may be adioyned the great miracles that are done in euery age, yea almoſt euery yeare in diuers places by Saintes now raigning with Chriſt, but ſpecially by the moſt Bleſſed Virgin, which in thoſe places where they are wrought are manifeſt to all men, and may be ſeene and felt of all, and which are alſo confirmed by the publicke teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyes of ſworne wittneſſes, after

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:5297:40"/>Biſhops. Biſhops alſo haue their order from other Biſhops: and theſe likewiſe againe from others: and ſo futhermore vpwards to the Apoſtles, who receiued this power immediatly from Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>As all men therfore, according to their vitall and naturall power, do by a long courſe of genealogy deſcend from our firſt Parent Adam: ſo do all miniſters of the Catholike Church, according to their ſupernaturall power, by a longe ſucceſſion of ordination and ſanctification, deſcend from Chriſt our Lord, who is the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi>

                        <p>Now that theſe religions are
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:5297:48"/>new it is manifeſt. Firſt, for that we can nominate and bring forth their firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, tyme, place and maner how they were brought firſt in, and who they were that oppoſed themſelues againſt them: what great ſtyrres and troubles alſo were raiſed euery where about them; and laſtly how, and by whome they where condemned as noueltyes and hereſies. And what can be a more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ſigne of nouelty then this? In like maner all other hereſies, that haue byn brought in againſt the Apoſtolike do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt are conuinced of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uclty, for that we can ſhew what tyme euery one of them began, in what place, who was the Author, who were the oppoſers therof, and laſtly by whome they were condemned of nouelty.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, before the yeare of our Lord 1517. Lutheraniſme was neuer heard of in the world, nor likewiſe Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiniſme nor Anabaptiſme, which are the daughters of Lutheraniſme. For that it is manifeſt out of Authors that when Luther firſt began to peepe out his head, there was no other religion known to be exerciſed in the world (beſides the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:5297:48"/>Iewiſh, Mahometan and Pagan) but the Catholike, and that of the Huſſites.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, if yow ſay, that any of theſe Religions, for examples ſake the Lutheran, alwayes was, but yet lay hid: then I aske in what place the ſame lay hid, in what kingdome or towne and who were the patrons &amp; defenders therof? Againe how know yow, that this religion was before, when as the ſame cannot be knowne but by ſome authors, who do not ſo much as inſinuate any ſuch thing, but the quite contrary. Furthermore, wheras in euery age, and place there haue byn Inquiſitours of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall noueltyes; by what meanes then could this religion ly hid for ſo many ages, that it ſhould neuer be diſcouered or that neuer any one of the followers or teachers therof ſhould fall into their hands, and be puniſhed? Surely neuer any hereticall Sect could yet ly hid ſo cunningly, but that ſhe ſhould often haue byn deprehended, and publikely called into examination and queſtion. Moreouer if before Luther, that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had byn in the world, how chance that the followers therof, who had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:5297:49"/>layn hidden, did not then come publikely forth, when Luther began to preach, and acknowledge him for the Doctour of their faith &amp; League-maker of their religion? How hapned it then, that they came not abroad in publicke, and imbraced him as their fellow, and Patrone, who had now at laſt ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty this their Religion, ſo long before layn hidden and oppreſſed in ſecret cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? But no ſuch appeared that were euer followers of that Religion before, but that as many as ioyned themſelues with Luther,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>De Miſſa Angulari lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cont. Zuingl.</hi>
                           </note> did profeſſe Catholike religion before; as Luther himſelfe was alſo Catholike before and a Friar, who for 15. yeares togeather had daily and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noutly ſaid maſſe, as himſelfe confeſſeth.</p>
                        <p>By all which it is more cleere then the ſunne, that Luthers Religion is altogether new, and was not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne vnto the world before his tyme: nor that there was any company of men, no not perhaps ſo much as any one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon before <hi>Luther,</hi> who profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſed the ſame Religion, that is to ſay, held all and euery of the ſame heads of beliefe, or the ſame body of doctrine,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:5297:49"/>which Luther did. And although Luther tooke ſome of his opinions from the old heretikes, notwithſtanding Luthera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme is not therfore the ſame Religion with that of the old heretikes, but only in part: for that a Religion is the imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and comprehending of al the heads of beliefe, which are ordayned and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to belong to faith: but none before Luther did euer teach this imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of opinions.</p>
                        <p>The ſame is likewiſe conuinced by another reaſon: for that it is manifeſt, that the Ancient Fathers and doctors of all ages, were not of Luthers religion; ſeing they teach Frewil, neceſſity of good workes, Merit of life euerlaſting, and poſſibility of the Diuine Law: They do alſo allow of the Inuocation of Saints, worſhip and honour of holy reliques &amp; Images, ſacrifice of maſſe for the quicke and dead, Order of miniſters in the Church, monaſticall vowes, Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Counſells, the faſt of Lent, and the like; all which things the Lutheran Religion doth reiect as ſuperſtitions, impious, and iniurious to God. Now that the ancient Fathers did profeſſe and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:5297:50"/>allow all theſe things before rehearſed, is moſt manifeſt out of their owne wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: neyther can the Lutherans or Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiniſtes deny the ſame; but only ſay that theſe things were moles, or blemiſhes amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient Fathers. Goodly moles ſurely, ſuperſtition, Idolatry &amp; Impiety! But if the doctors of former ages did not profeſſe this religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but for the moſt part reproue and diſallow it: then is it eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the ſame is not ancient, but new. For no religion was euer accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Church for true, but that which the ancient Fathers &amp; doctors of the Church did hold and profeſſe.</p>
                        <p>Wherof it euidently followeth, that Lutheran religion is not Chriſts religion. For that Chriſts religion is not new, but ancient: but Lutheran re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is new (as we haue ſhewed) and not ancient. Chriſts religion hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes floriſhed in the world euer ſynce the Apoſtles tyme: but Luthers religion hath not ſo done, but began within theſe 100. yeares: and before that tyme we haue ſhewed that it was not. Againe, if <hi>Luthers</hi> religion be truely Chriſts religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then is the viſible company of men
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:5297:50"/>that imbrace the ſame, the true Church of Chriſt: Therfore Chriſts Church was not before <hi>Luther,</hi> becauſe the Lutheran Religion which doth make the true Church, was not before Luther, as we haue demonſtrated. For if yow ſay, that <hi>Luthers</hi> religion was in the Apoſtles tymes, and in ſome of the former ages; then muſt yow proue, that there were ſome men in thoſe tymes, who imbraced and profeſſed his opinions. Surely we eaſily proue the contrary: for that it is euident, that Maſſe for the quicke and dead, Order of Miniſters in the Church, monaſticall vowes, and the like which are repugnant to the Lutheran religion were in vſe in the Church in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles tymes, and the next ſucceeding A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
                        <p>But let vs grant, that Luthers religion was in the Apoſtles tymes, and ſomwhat after: yet at leaſtwiſe in the third and fourth age it began to fayle &amp; fall quite away. Which thing the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran Doctors themſelues do alſo confeſſe, as may be ſeene by that great Centurian worke ſetforth by them, in the 2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10. <hi>Century, or age, and</hi> 4. <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
                           <pb n="82" facs="tcp:5297:51"/>of euery <hi>Century.</hi> Therfore by this accompt the Church of Chriſt, at leaſt for 1300. years hath fallen away &amp; peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: for that ſo long tyme at the leaſt, it is euident that Lutheran religion was not, but the quite contrary to haue byn extant and floriſhed. As alſo by this accompt, the true religion was extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed for ſo many ages, the Ghoſpell obſcured, Chriſtes Church ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, vntil the Dutch Prophet <hi>Luther</hi> roſe vp, and diſperſed that lamentable dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knes, through the light of the Ghoſpell, to the world, and reedified the ruines of the Church. This do the Lutherans often inſinuate in diuers townes of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> when as they wryte vpon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts of their houſes, in great Capitall letters, theſe, or the like words: <hi>Such a yeare &amp;c. appeared the true light of Chriſts Ghoſpell to this Citty, Superſtition put downe &amp;c.</hi> But if the Church of Chriſt periſhed for ſo many ages, how then is it true, that ſhe is built vpon a rocke, and not rather vpon ſand? How then is it ſaid, that the

                        <p>Againe, if yow ſay that Luthers Church &amp; religion was in all Ages from the Apoſtles tymes, but yet in ſecret and hidden: beſides that ſuch a fiction wanteth an Author, to affirme it, the ſame is voyd of all probability as we haue now ſhewed. But, be it ſo:
<note place="margin">The Church of Chriſt ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<note n="(g)" place="margin">
                              <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.</note> mountayne, that filleth the whole earth. For that the Church of Chriſt muſt be conſpicuous &amp; manifeſt to the world, that by her excelleny and comlines, by her manner and outward
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:5297:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſhew ſhe, as it were, may intice Gentiles vnto her: ſo as they that will become Chriſtians, may know whither to go, to whome to haue recourſe, and from whome to receiue inſtruction.</p>
                        <p>Likewiſe her Doctrine and faith muſt needs be alſo manifeſt, or els the ſame would be vnprofitable to the world, nor could ſhe conuert Gentiles. So as in the greateſt perſecutions that euer were, ſhe neuer lay ſo hidden, but that ſhe might be knowne to all, as out of the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtoryes is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; wherby it came to paſſe that ſhe had ſo many martyrs. Againe, if ſhe had layn hidden for ſo many ages, ſhe had byn altogeather vnworthy of the Name of a Church. For how may ſhe be called the Church of Chriſt, that dareth not publickely to profeſſe the true Doctrine of Chriſt? or that ſhe ſhould be ſo faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harted &amp; fearfull of death, as to hide her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in a darke cormer, ſo many ages togeather and dare, to come abroad into the light, leaſt ſhe ſhould be ſeene? And laſt of all, how can ſhe be called the Church of Chriſt, that for ſo many ages hath not only hidden herſelfe, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:5297:52"/>the true profeſſion of faith; but hath profeſſed alſo a falſe faith, to wit Papiſtry, adored Idols, and defiled her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with a thouſand ſuperſtitions and ſacriledges? For that before Luther, all Chriſtians did carry themſelues outwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly in all points as Catholikes, or els ſtraight would they haue byn apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and accuſed by the Inquiſitors and Biſhops, and puniſhed as heret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therfore ſhould the Church of Chriſt haue byn more miſerable, then the ruines of the Synagoge, or the lewiſh Sect, which alwayes in ſome place or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had their Synagoges and free pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their Religion, nor was euer conſtrayned, at leaſt generally, to the worſhip of Idols. She ſhould, I ſay, haue byn more miſerable then all hereticall ſects and Conuenticles whatſoeuer. For that there was neuer any Sect of any name, which had not her temples, her religious houſes, her Couuents, her Biſhops, the forme and profeſſion of her faith, that ſo ſhe might be knowne of all.</p>
                        <p>Wherby it is manifeſt, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more abſurdly ſaid, then
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:5297:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>that the Church of Chriſt hath layen hid for ſo many ages: and therfore I do conclude with this Dilemma: That the Lutheran or Caluinian religion, was eyther before their Authors (to wit Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Caluin) or it was not. If it were not, then is it altogeather new, and therfore cannot be the religion of Chriſt: which is ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. If it were before the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, then was it ſecret, &amp; therfore cannot be the religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt, which is a wayes apparent &amp; manifeſt. And whatſoeuer in this diſcourſe hath byn ſaid and proued concerning Lutheran religion, yow muſt vnderſtand to haue byn ſaid and proued alſo of Caluiniſme and Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, for that the ſelfe ſame nouelty and reaſons belong to all three, but that for perſpicuityes ſake, and not often to repeat with tediouſnes all three names, we haue only nominated one.</p>
                        <p>Therfore do I conclude with the words of <hi>S. Hierome,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Hier. Dial. contra Lucifer. in fine.</hi>

Thou muſt</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>remayne in that Church, which was founded by the Apoſtles, and continueth vntil this very day. And if by chance thou shouldeſt he are thoſe that be called Chriſtians,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:5297:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>to be named of ſome other, and net of Ieſus Chriſt, to u it of the Marcionites, Valentinia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, Montaniſtes &amp;c. know thou certainly that, that is not the Church of Chriſt, but the Synagogue of Antichriſt: for that becauſe they were inſtitued afterward, they do demonſtrate themſelnes to be thoſe, whome the Apoſtle foretould &amp;c. Nor let them flatter themſelues, if out of certaine places of Scripture they do ſeemete affirme that with they ſay: for that the Diuell did alſo alleagde Scripture for his purpoſe: and the force of Scripture doth not conſiſt in reading, but in vnderſtanding.</hi> So <hi>S. Hierome.</hi> Nouelty therfore is a ſigne of hereſy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tould by the Apoſtle: denomination is a ſigne of nouelty: and the vſurping of Scripture, is common to the Diuell himſelfe, and all hereſyes.</p>

<note place="margin">Want of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> they do not only want ſucceſſion of Chayre and authority, but euen the ordination of degrees, deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the Apoſtles.

<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.</note> and warning him thus: <hi>Do not neglect the grace which is in thee, which grace is giuen thee by propheſy, with impoſition of the hands of Prieſthood:</hi> that is to ſay, of thoſe Biſhops who togeather with the Biſhop
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:5297:55"/>that doth ordaine, do lay their hands vpon him that is ordained, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers do expound it.</p>
                        <p>By which it is cleere and euident, that the Lutherans and Caluiniſts haue neither of theſe forſaid powers from the Apoſtles, nor can they deriue the ſame from the Apoſtles, and conſequently in that they do not deſcend from them, they haue not the true religion and Church with them. For that the true Church, according to both powers ought to be deriued, and to haue conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with them from the Apoſtles, as we haue ſhewed before: ſeing that all power ſpirituall ought to be deriued from Chriſt through the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſours, by a continuall and orderly ſucceſſion, and communication to other miniſters of the Church, as the corporall life of man is deriued by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine meanes, through a continuall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion from our firſt parent Adam, to the laſt.</p>
                        <p>For euen as in the old Teſtament, there were no prieſts except thoſe that deſcended from the Tribe of <hi>Leui<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough <hi>Aaron:</hi> ſo in the new, there are no
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:5297:56"/>prieſts or Biſhops, except thoſe that deſcend in degree of <hi>Order,</hi> and power of <hi>Iuriſdiction</hi> from Chriſt the chiefe Prieſt, through the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſours. And therfore as the Sina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue could not be without prieſts, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending by a continuall ſucceſſion from <hi>Aaron:</hi> ſo the Church of Chriſt cannot be without Prieſts, or Biſhops, deſcending by the ſame continuall ſucceſſion, from the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſours. But the Congregation of Lutherans and Caluiniſtes, had neuer any ſuch mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; had neuer any Biſhops-lawfully ordayned amongſt them, deſcending in power of Iuriſdiction from the Apoſtles or their ſuceſſours, to gouerne the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And therfore it is cleere, that the Church of Chriſt is not with them.</p>

                        <p>THE third reaſon is; becauſe theſe Religions were brought in by them that were ſent by no lawfull au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but came of themſelues: and for

For what is it, <hi>to enter in at the dore,</hi> but to enter by the lawfull way, and by lawfull authority? The dore is the ordinary way, and made of purpoſe wherby to enter into the ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, and wherby is deſigned that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, by which the Miniſters of the Church are to be admitted into the ſheepfold of Chriſt, to gouerne and feed his ſheepe.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, our Lord ſaith in <hi>S. Iohns Ghoſpell:
<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Ioan.</hi> 7.</note> he that ſpeaketh of himſelfe ſeeketh his owne glory: but he that ſeketh the glory of him that ſent him, he is faithfull, and in him there is no iniuſtice.</hi> By which words we
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:5297:57"/>are warned not to belieue them, who are not lawfully ſent, but come of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, becauſe they ſeeke their owne glory, and therfore they do not ſpeake for truth, but for their owne praiſe and comodity, and thither do they direct all their doctrine.</p>
                        <p>And finally the Apoſtle in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the Hebrews, doth account this miſſion ſo neceſſary that he doth require the ſame in our Sauiour Chriſt, ſaying: <hi>Neyther doth any man take the honour to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but he that is called of God as Aaron.
<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5.</note> So Chriſt alſo did not glorify himſelfe, that he might be made a High Prieſt; but he that ſpake to him: My Sonne art thou, this day haue I begotten thee.</hi> Wherby our Sauiour did ſo often incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to the Iewes his miſſion, to wit, that he came not of himſelfe, but was ſent of his Father; and confirmeth the ſame many wayes.</p>
                        <p>From whence it is cleerly dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that <hi>Luther, Caluin,</hi> and the reſt of theſe new Doctours are not to be heard, but their doctrine altogeather to be ſhunned: becauſe it is manifeſt, that they were not ſent by any lawfull authority, but came of themſelues. It is alſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:5297:58"/>that they vſurped vnto themſelues the offices of magiſtrates and Paſtors, &amp; the Authority of reforming the Church. It is manifeſt. I ſay, that they came not in at the dore, and by the lawfull way, but cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>mbed ouer ſome other way into the ſheepfold: and therfore according to our Sauiours iudgment and ſentence, they are to be accompted for theeues and robbers.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps they will ſay, that they were ſent of Chriſt immediatly, as in old tyme the Prophets were ſent by God in an extraordinary manner to reforme the people; and as the Apoſtles were ſent by Chriſt our Sauiour to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uert the world, and as <hi>S. Paul,</hi> after the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Lord, who was not ſent of men, nor yet receiued the Ghoſpell from men but immediatly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God himſelfe.</p>
                        <p>To this I anſwere firſt, it is not inough to ſay, and ſtoutly to affirme but it muſt be proued, and conuinced to be true, leaſt it may ſeeme to the people &amp; ordinary paſtors to reiect them as decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, for a lawfull cauſe: as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, did not only ſay that they were ſent of God, but ſhewed
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:5297:58"/>the ſame alſo abundantly by heauenly ſignes.</p>
                        <p>Secondly all Archeretikes and falſe Prophets throughout euery age haue affirmed the ſame, to wit, that they were ſent of God, &amp; from him receaued their Authority. And therfore eyther we muſt receaue them all or none. For why ſhould I (for example ſake) rather belieue that <hi>Caluin</hi> was ſent of God, then <hi>Luther,</hi> or <hi>Menno,</hi> or <hi>Munzer, Arius,</hi> or any other Archeretike, when as he can produce no greater ſignes or teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies for his miſſion then they?</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, if <hi>Caluin</hi> were ſent of God, then <hi>Luther</hi> was not ſent of God; and ſo likewiſe to the contray. Becauſe if two men do propheſy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary things, and that the one doth condemne the others propheſy and doctrine of errour and hereſy, the one doth ſo deſtroy the others religion: and therfore if they were both ſent of God, it ſeemes that the ſpirit of God doth oppugne, deny, and ouerthrow it ſelfe, deſtroying by one, what he had built by another. But amongſt the Prophets truly ſent by God there hath alwaies bin a principal vnity
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:5297:59"/>and conſent in doctrine.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, if Luther or Caluin were ſet of God to reforme the Church, I demaund then what tyme, and in what place, God gaue them this Office? what words did he vſe vnto them, cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther internall or externall? In what manner did he declare vnto them the chiefe heads and points of this Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? what order and manner did he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them? How, or in what forme did he appeare vnto them? Externally in a viſible ſhape, as he did to <hi>S. Paul?</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally by imaginary viſion, in ſome extaſis, as he did to the Prophets, &amp; to <hi>S. Iohn</hi> Euangeliſt in the Apocalyps? For that he is wont to obſerue al theſe things with thoſe whome he ſendeth. And the Prophets themſelues preſently in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their preaching did explicate and declare all theſe things to the people, that they might vnderſtand of whome they were ſent, or what comman<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement was giuen vnto them to performe, as out of the Propheſyes of <hi>Iſay, Ieremy, Ezechiel, Daniel,</hi> and others is manifeſt, that they were all wont to premit theſe things firſt of all. And ſo likewiſe is it manifeſt
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:5297:59"/>what tyme, and with what words our Sauiour ſent the Apoſtles, and what he inioyned them to do &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>But now theſe our new Prophets were ſo ſimple, that they did not thinke of feigning any ſuch thing, if they would haue had themſelues thought to haue byn ſent immediatly from God: and therfore they made no mention at all therof; which is a moſt certaine and manifeſt token of lying and falſhood, when of neceſſity they be driuen to ſay they were ſent from God.</p>
                        <p>For who can doubt, but that, if they had felt the leaſt ſemblance or ſhaddow of this Diuine miſſion, they would haue preſently publiſhed the ſame in the firſt front of their writings, and haue manifeſted the ſame to the world, to wit, the expreſſe tyme, place, manner, commandement of God, and other circumſtances belonging there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to?</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, I adde, that if they were ſent of God, they were not only ſent as reformers of Manners, as the Prophets were; but as reformers alſo of the whole doctrine and Religion: and therfore a
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:5297:60"/>moſt exact deſcription of this miſſion &amp; an expreſſe mention of ſuch things as God would haue reformed, had by nalto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather neceſſary: &amp; that the ſame ſhould haue byn propounded to the Church, in God his name, and in the very word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> that he ſpake them, as the Prophets were wont to do when they did propound to the people Gods diuine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements in his name. But theſe new Prophets haue not proceeded ſo, but haue gone from one opinion to another vpon mere chaunces, and as times and things haue ſo required: as it is wont to happen in contentious and debates, when mens minds be more and more prouoked to anger and reuenge; and as they learned by experience to preferre moſt their owne comodityes, and oppugne the Sea Apoſtolike, that condemned them. For whatſoeuer they thought might moſt endomage the Popes authority, or profit and confirme their owne, that they eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhed as a point of faith, and the very kernell of the word of God, as afterward we ſhall ſhew.</p>
                        <p>Sixtly. In humane Policy and Gouerment it is not inough for a man
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:5297:60"/>that is ſent from a Prince, who is far off, and cannot be ſpoken with, to ſay that he is ſent from him to execute ſuch or ſuch Authority; but he muſt haue letters Pate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ſufficient, ſealed with the Princes ſeale, which are notwithſtanding care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully examined for feare of deceyt; and if by chance any ſigne of impoſture be deprehended therin, he is not admitted vntill further teſtimony be produced. The ſame we ſee in like manner in the Popes Legates and Nuntij, who all muſt ſhew their Patents Authenticall, wherin their Miſſion &amp; Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion is conteyned; or els they are not receyued nor haue Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. What ſottiſhneſſe then is it to admit into the Church and Kingdome of Chriſt, not only new Paſtors and Teachers, but Reformers alſo of the whole Religion, wheron the Church conſiſteth, vpon pretence and colour only, that they ſay they are ſent of Chriſt, and haue the ſpirit God, not ſhewing their Patents, nor any other ſigne or token, wherby to confirme the ſame?</p>
                        <p>Seauenthly. The very computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of tyme is alſo mightily againſt them. For if the Church from 600. yeares
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:5297:61"/>after Chriſt hath byn decayed and fallen away, and conſequently byn made the Synagoge of Antichriſt, as they ſay it hath: then how happeneth it, that the Miſſion of theſe new Reformers hath byn delayed vntill now? Why hath God forſaken his Church for whole 900, yeares, and ſuffered her to be thus ruina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſwym in all Idolatry and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, as though ſhe did nothing belong to him: and now after all this tyme at laſt to ſend theſe new Reformers or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitects vnto her? Is this the loue of Chriſt, thinke yow, towards his Church, which he waſhed with his bloud, quickned with his ſpirit, and adopted to his Spouſe? Far more louingly the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo, did he beare himſelfe towards his hand mayde, to wit, the Iewiſh Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goge, to whome he ſent Prophets, and did not forſake her, although ſhe fell into Idolatry and wickednes, ſonding vnto her continually, euen to her very laſt end and deſtruction, his ſeruants; and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auouring by al meanes poſſible to reclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me her. And therefore if theſe men will needs ſeeme to be Reformers, they ſhould haue feigned the Church to haue peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:5297:61"/>a little before, and not to haue layne rotten and putriſyed in her fall, for ſo many ages; or els the great ſpace of tyme betweene, doth confute their miſſion, and ſhow it to be imprudently fei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned.</p>
                        <p>Eightly, To theſe may be added other moſt certaine ſignes of their not ſending from Chriſt: as for example, their bad life, their pride, their contempt of the holy Fathers, their errours and vntruthes wherin they are euery day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and taken, their inconſtancy of doctrine &amp;c. of which I meane to treat in the enſuing reaſon.</p>
                        <p>And laſt of all, they teach that nothing is to be belieued but what is in Scripture. Let them then ſhew vs out of Scripture that they were ſent of God to reforme the Church; in what place and in what words the Scripture ſaith this Authority was graunted vnto Luther or Caluin; or otherwiſe we may not belieue them (themſelues being witneſſes) and much leſſe accept them for Reformers of the Church.</p>
                        <p>The Lutherans indeed do go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to eſtabliſh the miſſion of their
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:5297:62"/>Prophet, by a certaine Chronographical propheſy out of <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> &amp; <hi>S.

For that God is there prouoked in ſuch ſore that he reuengeth with condigne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment ſo great wickednes &amp; impiety, ſhewing by the beauty of his ſanctity how greatly all kind of ſynne doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe him.

                        <p>Heerhence it is, that ſo many as euer haue byn ſent of God immediately to teach or inſtruct the people, haue come endued from him with miracles, or other ſupernaturall ſignes, wherby their Miſſion hath byn made manifeſt to the people. For ſo did <hi>Moyſes,</hi> when he
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:5297:64"/>was to bring the children of Iſrael out of Egypt, and to giue them a Law, come with a mighty power of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and wrought very many either himſelfe, or God by him, as often as he appeared vnto him in a viſible ſhape. So did all the Prophets confirme their miſſion, eyther with miracles, or with reuelation of myſteries. The ſame alſo the Lord of Prophets himſelfe, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he might haue cleerly conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced out of Scripture, that he was the true Meſſias, and that by the teſtimony alſo of <hi>S. Iohn Baptiſt:</hi> yet notwithſtanding preſently in the begining of his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, he ſhewed by many miracles, that he was ſent from God the Father, for the ſaluation of men; in ſo much as he ſaid vnto the Phariſies who for hate and malice belieued him not, that if they would not belieue him for his owne ſake, yet at leaſtwiſe being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced which the greatnes of his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, they ſhould belieue him. In like manner did all the Apoſtles confirme their miſſion with miracles amongſt the Iewes and gentles: as alſo did the firſt preachers and Apoſtles of diuers nations
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:5297:64"/>who brought them from Paganiſme to our faith &amp; religion. Wherfore let theſe new Prophets brag neuer ſo much that they be ſent immediatly from God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they confirme the ſame with mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and ſupernaturall ſignes, as all thoſe who were ſent indeed inmediatly from God, haue done, they be not any way to be heard or regarded.</p>
                        <p>Nor doth that argument any thing auayle againſt vs, that <hi>S. Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> wrought no miracles; becauſe God did many &amp; ſupernaturall things about him, which wel witneſſed his miſſion. Beſides the auſterity and ſanctity of his life was no ſmall miracle; ſo as no man can doubt, but that he was ſent of God.</p>
                        <p>Secondly: Miracles were very neceſſary to haue proued, that they were not only ſent as correctors of manners, but alſo as reformers and correctors of the whole religion, to build vp a new the Church that was fallen, to raiſe to life the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of Chriſt that was dead &amp; to make all things new againe. What great miracles had there needed to haue byn; to haue conuinced the world to beleeue theſe meruailous and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:5297:65"/>things; and to haue receiued the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers therof for ſuch?

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:5297:65"/>yow) that all the miracles of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, yea of Chriſt himſelfe, ſhould be renewed againe in ſuch a reformer?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, for ſo much as the Catholike religion, which now flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth, hath byn in poſſeſſion for more then a thouſand yeares (which our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries do alſo confeſſe) in ſuch ſort that the ſame is accompted throughout the whole world for the true religion, and thoſe that depart from her are held for heretickes: therfore without very great and moſt euident ſignes it be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that this poſſeſſion was wicked and vniuſt, it cannot now be thruſt out and owerthrowne. Againe theſe ſignes muſt be ſo perſpicuous for the conuincement of mans vnderſtanding, that there be left no place of doubt or tergiuerſation; for els their be not bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to belieue, but rather ſtill to adhere to this ſo long poſſeſſion and no wayes to forſake their religion. Moreouer ſeing that the Catholike reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion hath ſhined with the greateſt glory of miracles, of wiſdome, and of ſanctity of her followers throughout all former ages, and doth at this day alſo ſhine: it is needfull therfore of greater and more
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:5297:66"/>euident miracles now, wherby lawfully put her out of poſſeſſion and reiect her; as alſo there is more need of greater knowledg, ſanctity, and publike fame in the followers of theſe new religions now, then euer was in the old.</p>
                        <p>And laſtly: if the religion of the old Teſtament amongſt the Iewes was to be changed, and that they were to paſſe from a ſhaddow to the truth, or from a type or patterne to the true ſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler it ſelfe; although our Lord might moſt clerly haue conuinced and ſhewed out of the Scriptures that this mutation and change was to be made, and that himſelfe was ſent of God for the ſame purpoſe he thought good notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme the ſame with very ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>y &amp; moſt wonderfull miracles, that there might be left vnto them no occaſion of doubt or turning backe: how greatmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles then ſhall we thinke to be needfull now for the changing of religion in the new Teſtament, when as the Scriptures do cleerly denounce that there thalbe no more changes made but that God wilbe preſent with her, for her aſſiſtance to the worlds end, and that the gates of hell
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:5297:66"/>ſhall not preuaile againſt her. For what wiſdome were it for any man to belieue ſo great a thing, ſo new and paradoxicall ſo much againſt Scripture and iudgment of all the ancientt Fathers, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary great miracles? Nay, what miracles can there be great inough to make a man at leaſt probably to belieue ſo ſtrang a thing?</p>
                        <p>Heerhence it is manifeſt, that we haue great cauſe to require of them ſuch miracles, and that they deale perfidiouſly with vs when as they would haue vs to giue them credit in matters of ſo great importance, without miracles; and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we do belieue all vpon their bare word, they preſently raiſe vp grieuous preſecutions againſt vs.</p>
                        <p>But they will ſay.
<note place="margin">Whether do they proue ther do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine out of the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</note> We proue our opinions and doctrine out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.

                        <p>Againe, their arguments like vnto
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:5297:67"/>ſpiders webbs are very eaſily diſſolued by Catholike Doctors: beſides that there are ſo many new Reformers ſprong vp within theſe 80. or 90. yeares, ſo many repayrers of the decayed Church, ſo ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>y reniuers of the extinct Religion, who alſo be moſt contrary one to anothers: and what one buildeth vp, another pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth downe: yet notwithſtanding do they all confirme their opinions out of the Scriptures, all do reſt vpon her teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony alone, all do make Scripture the only foundation of their building: and therfore, the proofe of all is to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or of none.</p>
                        <p>And laſtly, ſeing that nothing is to be belieued vnleſſe Scripture ſay it: Where I pray yow, doth it ſay, that you, or he, or ſuch a one was ſent of God for the reforming and reſtoring of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed Church and Religion?</p>
                        <p>They will ſay,
<note place="margin">Whether it be a miracle to haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers.</note> perhaps, that they want not miracles; for that it is a very great miracle, that in ſo ſhort tyme, ſo many haue imbraced this new Ghoſpell. And this perhaps might haue ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, if their religion were more auſtere, and ſtrict vnto the fleſh, then is the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:5297:67"/>Catholike. But ſeing that this their new Doctrine doth baniſh all auſterity and ſharpnes of the Catholike Religion, and giue all liberty to the fleſh, what miracle is it, if many follow and imbrace the ſame? what meruayle is it, if weighty things fal to the ground, when as their props be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away, or that riuers run into the ſea, their da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes &amp; ſtops remoued? our corrupt nature doth moſt of all incline to liberty, which it findeth in theſe new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, and therfore we do the ſoner im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and follow them, not becauſe we being perſuaded by the force of reaſon, do belieue that they are more holy; but becauſe we find in them, that which we ſought for, and that which without feare we might enioy, vnder the colour of religion and piety.</p>
                        <p>Moreouer this miracle may aſwel be brought on the behalfe of all the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes of all theſe new Reformers, as of one: for that many haue ioyned themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues not only to the Caluiniſts, but alſo to the Lutherans and Anabaptiſtes; and therfore they muſt be all holy and come from God as their Author. But God cannot deny himſelfe, nor deſtroy that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:5297:68"/>which he hath eſtabliſhed, and therfore cannot be Author of ſo contrary religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; the one damning the other to the pit of hell.</p>

                        <p>Of Luthers infamy it is manifeſt to all the whole world, that wheras he being a profeſſed Monke and a Prieſt, he ioyned himſelfe to a profeſſed Nunne: which fact by the iudgment of all learned Doctors purchaſeth infamy. For if by the Emperours lawes, that man be

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:5297:69"/>in Germany, and that the office therof hauing heertofore belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the <hi>Auguſtine</hi> Friars, now they being at this tyme pretermitted, the ſame was giuen in Commiſſion to the <hi>Dominicans.</hi> Which thing Luther taking in very ill part, began with a ſplene to preach againſt Indulgences: and though he were therof admoniſhed, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, notwithſtanding by little and little he not only continued the ſame, but adioyned heerunto many more and greater articles of faith againſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Pope; wherby he cauſed wonderfull troubles and garboyles throughout all <hi>Germany,</hi> as largely wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>Ioannes Cochlaeus</hi> (that was an eye wittnes of all theſe things) in the Acts of <hi>Luther an.</hi> 1517.

                        <p>Secondly, for that <hi>Luther</hi> in his Epiſtle to thoſe of <hi>Strasburge</hi> writeth, that he would gladly deny the Reall

Who euer noted any ſuch conditions or qualityes either in the Apoſtles or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who were all moſt humble, and no wayes infamous for any wickednes?

For to omit all thoſe things which they do falſely obiect to Catholiks, and which they do falſly affirme to be noueltyes in our Doctrine, and vnknowne to the ancients: To omit alſo all hiſtoricall and chronographicall errors, I wil lay forth only two of theirs of moſt moment which are common to then both. The one, <hi>That we haue no fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, but all things do happen through an ineui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table neceſſity.</hi> The other, <hi>That God is no leſſe the Author and ſorcer of euill works, then of good.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That theſe be moſt manifeſt and pernicious errors, is euident, becauſe they take a way all policy, all good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, all lawes and preceptes, all Iudges and Tirbunales. For that all theſe are in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:5297:74"/>vayne, if there be no frewill in man. Moreouer the puniſhing of all kind of wickednes ſhalbe vniuſt alſo: for that whatſoeuer is not free of it ſelfe, &amp; what ſoeuer is done by God as the author and compeller therof, deſerueth no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And finally by this meanes they take away hell it ſelfe, and all puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the life to come, and bring in a moſt profuſe liberty to all kind of vice and ſinne, as before we haue ſhewed in the ſecond Conſideration.</p>
                        <p>Theſe very two opinions, haue giuen occaſion to many, to go fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Calui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme to Turciſme, or els to Atheiſme. For that it is much better to haue no God,

                        <p>By which it is manifeſt, that theſe men did not only, not ſpeake out of the ſpirit of God, when as they are ſo full of errors and contradictions; but that they be impoſtors alſo &amp; deceyuers of the people. For whoſoeuer affirmeth his Doctrine, wherin there be ſo many errors and contradictions, to be of God; is preſumed not to deale ſincerely, but to ſpeake againſt his conſcience, and to beguile the people: ſeeing that it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that he that doth ſo, can haue no in ward light fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, wherby to make him certaine of the verity of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or the teſtimony of God, becauſe God cannot witneſſe or reueale Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines contrary or repugnant one to the other. With what force then do they ſo bouldly affirme, that their Doctrine is
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:5297:76"/>of God, or the Doctrine of Chriſt? therfore they do not deale vprightly in this affayre, but would only deceyue the world.</p>
                        <p>Some perhaps may anſwere her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto and ſay, that now and then they erred in the beginning when as they had not as yet fully the ſpirit of God; but afterward they neither erred, nor chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their opinions. But this anſwere hath no colour of truth. For whoſoeuer haue byn ſent immediatly from God to teach and inſtruct the people, they had preſently in the very beginning of their miſſion an infallible aſſiſtance and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from God, ſo as they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer erre the leaſt iote in their Doctrine, as it is manifeſt of the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. Nay in that beginning, they had moſt of all need of that direction, becauſe then euery thing is more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly ſifted and looked into, and their authority and miſſion is compared with other learned men and their Doctrine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For if they had byn taken in any error or contradiction, all their credit and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority had byn loſt, and they had wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily byn reiected as falſe impoſtors and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:5297:77"/>deceyuers of the people. And ſo if <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> had byn ſent from God to repayre and reedify the Church, it had byn ſpecially neceſſary that ſtraight in their begining, their Doctrine had byn ſolide, and without all contradiction, leaſt they might haue byn reiected and contemned as deceyuers, and that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily. Againe I demaund, of them, when and at what tyme did they at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue that fulnes or plenitude of ſpirit, that they could not erre any longer? How ſhould this be manifeſt to the world, that men might know when to belieue them, and when not, to wit not in the beginning, but yet in the later end? For if this were not knowne, they might preſume, and that worthily, that they would erre as wel after, as they had done before.</p>
                        <p>And finally it is euident, that in all their life, they were variable, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, correcting, or contradicting themſelues almoſt in euery booke and worke they ſet forth; as before we haue ſhewed by that little we haue alleaged, and may do much more out of the many places produced by <hi>Cochlaeus, Coccius,</hi> and

                        <p>That this honour which is thus done to Saints, is not the worſhip proper vnto God, is manifeſt; becauſe we do not worſhip any Saint as ſupreme Lord &amp; Author of things, but only as a friend of him who is ſupreme Lord. For that we do ſo highly reſpect God, that we thinke thoſe whome he hath ſo highly exalted in glory, to be worthy alſo of ſome honour.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:5297:80"/>this hurt they do, is but for a little while; for after that the impudency of their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniations is once diſcouered, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doundeth to the great comendation of thoſe who were accuſed, and ſhame vnto them that were the plotters and abbet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters therof.</p>

Finally that nothing is added, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, that maketh to the ſubſtance of doctrine. All this cannot to be known by Scripture, but proued only by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine humane weake coniectures, if you take away the traditions of the Church, and ſo the whole foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our fayth ſhall rely vpon vncertaine coniectures. Moreouer the vertue and efficacy of the Scripture conſiſteth not in the ſound of the words, but in the ſenſe &amp; meaning, which is the life and ſoule of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But there may be a thouſand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies about the ſenſe, which cannot in any ſort be decided by the Scripture it ſelfe, if you take a way Traditions, and the expoſition of the Fathers, as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teacheth. For about the ſenſe of theſe words, <hi>Hoc eſt Corpus meum,</hi> and of many more, there is moſt eager diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwene the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Caluiniſts</hi>

                        <p>If you ſay with <hi>Caluin,</hi> that the iudgment touching the Scriptures, and the vnderſtanding of them, belongeth to an inward ſpirit, this is nothing but the dictamen of an internall ſpirit, that is, for the priuate iudgment of euery particular perſon to ſet down the firſt rule how to beleeue. For euery one may ſay, that he hath the ſpirit, and by the inſpiration therof can iudge and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, that this part, or booke is holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and not that: that this is the ſenſe not that.

But when he durſt not cleane reiect them, he would extennate their authority, and inſinuate, that they were not written with the ſpirit of God.</p>
                        <p>In like maner <hi>Caluin</hi> out of his own ſenſe iudgeth, that theſe words, <hi>Hoc eſt Corpus meum,</hi> haue this meaning, <hi>This breed is the figure of my body:</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> will haue it; <hi>This bread is truly my body.</hi> I omit other thing without nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, by which it appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>areth, that euery ones priuate iudgment is propoſed for arule of beleefe, or which is the ſame, that the Scripture it ſelfe is expounded and interpreted according to euery ones priuate iudgment.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, that is not any fit rule of beliefe, that is a like accommodated to contrary doctrines: but the ſcripture is accommodated to contrary Religions and doctrines; for as much as all the Sects of this time, though they do in an hoſtile manner diſſent and contend in very many, and thoſe the moſt inportant heads and grounds, do neuertheles make
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:5297:99"/>this rule to ſerue their turne, and doe vſe it for the mantayning of their opinions and hereſyes. For the <hi>Lutherans</hi> ſay they rely vpon Scripture: the <hi>Caluiniſts</hi> affirme the ſame: the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> alſo are nothing behind them in auerring, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be for them. And no meruaile, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe euery one of them taketh and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preteh the Scripture, not conforme to the comon vnderſtanding of the Church or the common expoſition of the Fathers as do the Catholikes, but according to the ſenſe of euery priuate ſpirit: in which ſort it may bee eaſilie accommodated to all hereſies. Whence it is euident that this rule ſo taken, ſerueth not the turne, whiles all is reduced to the iudgment of euery ones priuate ſpirit.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, if there were ſome iudge who in euery Controuerly, wherein he were to giue ſentence, ſhould ſo doe it, as it could not be certainly vnderſtood for whether party he pronounced the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, but both partyes ſhould contend, that the matter were adiudged and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined on their ſide, and that the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Iudge was expreſly &amp; plainly pronounced for them, ſuch an one in the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:5297:99"/>opinion of all men could not be thought a competent Iudge, ſith no matter in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie could bee determined or ended by ſentence giuen by him. For after ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, there would bee as greata conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about the ſentence it ſelfe, whether of them it might ſeeme to fauour as there had been before about the right that ech party had. And ſuch a Iudge is Holy Scripture, if you take away the Churches interpretation and declaration, and the expoſition of the holy Fathers; for as much as the ſentence therof is euer ſuch, as it cannot bee euident to both parties, whether of them it fauoureth whiles the one and the other doth ſtifly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that it is moſt plaine, that it hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and ſtandeth for them. And hence it is that controuerſies bee neuer ended: and therefore it is not onely a vaine, but alſo a ridiculous thing to appoint the Scripture alone for Iudge. For in euery controuerſy there ought ſuch a Iudge to be deſigned, who may ſo giue ſentence, as it may be manifeſt to all, and moſt of all to thoſe parties, on whoſe behalf the cauſe is adiuged, otherwiſe ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſy can neuer be ended.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="178" facs="tcp:5297:100"/>Wherfore thoſe, who make the Scripture alone the Iudge of matters in queſtion, do therin plainely manifeſt, that they admit not any iudge at all, by whome the cauſe may be determined, beſids their priuate iudgment alone. For they do, as if <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Caius</hi> hauing a ſuite at Law, would not haue any other Iudge in the matter but <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> his <hi>Code,</hi> together with the <hi>Pandects,</hi> without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any thing to do with the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Doctors: and <hi>Titus</hi> producing for his owne right ſome law, ſhould by it maintayne that the cauſe was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly adiudged for him. And <hi>Caius</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine ſhould deny it, who by citing an other law for himſelfe ſhould ſay, that it was cleare, that that law fauoured &amp; made for him, which <hi>Titus</hi> would in lake manner deny; and ſo they ſhould both depart without any deciſion of the cauſe or controuerſy in hand: would it not be a matter worthy of laughter? and all would ſay, that neyther of them deſired the determination or deciſion of the cauſe? And that neyther admitted other Iudge, then his owne iudgment? In the very like manner, in this, that they wil
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:5297:100"/>not haue any other Iudge then Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and euery one reſerueth the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereof to his owne ſpirit, they plainely ſhew, that they haue no will, that the cauſe ſhould be decided or defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by any lawfull way, nor to admit any Iudg, but their owne iudgment.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, how very inſufficient this rule of beliefe is, experience it ſelfe plainely teacheth. For we ſee, that there is not any end of controuerſies among them, euen about the greateſt matter of fayth, ſith at this very tyme the <hi>Lutherans, Caluiniſts,</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> are at bitter wars one with another about many points of fayth, and do impeach one the other of hereſy. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> do diſſent both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelues in many things, and from <hi>Luther</hi> himſelfe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>heir Father and Apoſtle: in ſo much as at this tyme there be reckoned thirty one principal Sects of <hi>Lutherans,</hi> different in name, and diſagre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in many points of doctrine. The <hi>Caluiniſts</hi> be at variance among themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, eſpecially in the Article touching <hi>the head of the Church.</hi> For a great part of them giueth that power to the ſecular Prince, though ſhe be a woman, and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:5297:101"/>theſe be called Proteſtants. Others of them hold the ſame for impiety, and blaſphemy, and thoſe they call <hi>Puritaus.</hi> The <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> differ among themſelues in very many things, ſo as of them there be numbred 14. diuers Sects, diſtinct both in names, and in points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                        <p>Finally, it is now come to this, that where euery one followeth this rule of Scripture alone, and relyeth vpon it, there be almoſt as many hereſyes, as there be heretiks. For the greater part of them, eſpecially the more ſimple, affirme that they little regard, or care what <hi>Luther,</hi> or <hi>Caluin</hi> taught, ſith they cleaue faſt to the holy Scriptures, and recur to the word of God, in which there cannot be any errour; and ſo they thinke themſelues very ſecure. And euery one vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Scripture according to his own capacity and ſenſe. Wherhence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that where they thinke they haue the Scripture for an infallible rule of their beliefe, inſteed of Scripture they haue, and follow their owne imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For whatſoeuer they imagine to be ſignified &amp; meant by the words of ſcrip
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:5297:101"/>ture, they take for the true fenſe of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: and ſo, lookehow many diuers imaginations of men there be, ſo many rules there be of beliefe.</p>
                        <p>But whence is it, that to euery one his owne imagination ſhould ſeeme the moſt true verity, and the very fenſe of Scripture? It procedeth partly of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine exceeding ſelfe-pleaſing lone, and eſtimation. For he, who maketh any great reckoning of himſelfe, eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth himſelfe, that all his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentions, and conceipts of mind be great and extraordinary: partly by working of the Diuell, who doth in wardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nert mensphanfyes, ſo as what they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, they forth with, for euery moſt light and idle poore reaſon, thinke to be moſt cuident truth. For whiles men wearied with the auncient Religion, &amp; loathing it, do auerſe the truth, &amp; longe to heare nou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>lt yes, they are by Gods iuſt iudgment ſuffered to be begnyled by the Diuell. Whereupon, whiles he worke the inwardly in their ſenſes, they thinke themſelues to haue recevued the light of Gods ſpirit, and vnto it they referre all iudgment touching matters of fayth.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:5297:102"/>Hence it is, that to euery ſect, &amp; almoſt to euery priuate man their owne appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion ſeemeth to be the pure word of God, neyther care they for all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that are brought to the contrary. The Apoſtle inſinuateth no leſſe, when he ſayth:
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.</note> 
                           <hi>For that they haue not receyued the Charity of truth, that they might be ſaued, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God will ſend them the operation of errour, that they may belieue lying.</hi> He ſhall ſend, not by way of commaund, but by giuing more power to the Diuell for the decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of them, who haue contemned the truth, or ancient Religion, and the thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of them into a thouſand errors.</p>
                        <p>But the moſt of them, eſpecially the ſimple, ſay: <hi>God will not permit them to be deluded, who ſearch the truth with an humble hart:</hi> for the hath promiſed, that, <hi>he will giue a good ſpirit to them who aſke him.</hi> And this do I: for I make my petition to God, that he would pleaſe to illuminate me, &amp; open vnto me the true ſenſe of the Scriptures, and I ceaſe not continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to ſearch them. This is a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of the Diuell. For how do they with an humble hart ſearch out the truth, who contemne &amp; makeno eſteeme
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:5297:102"/>of the iudgment of the Doctors of the Church, of the interpretation and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the holy Fathers, and of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions of Generall Councells? who refuſe to vſe the way appointed, and ſhewed by God, and require vnneceſſary reuelations? For from them they might vnderſtand the truth, and exempt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from all errour: but they haue not a will to ſubmit themſelues vnto them, thinking that they may by their owne induſtry, their owne wit, and priuate ſpirit, with a more facility, and certai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity find the truth out of the bare &amp; naked Scriptures. As though the holy Fathers, Doctors and Prelats of the Church, did eyther not ſearch the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or wanted the ſpirit of God, and ſound iudgment, ſo, as it paſſed their ſkil to ariue to the true vnderſtanding ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? What greater pride can there be thought, then that a priuare perſon, and comonly an Idiot, ignorant of all anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and good literature, ſhould prefer himſelfe before ſo great authority and holynes, and ſo great a number of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors?

<note place="margin">What wil an Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</note> I did therefore forſake the Catholike fayth, becauſe I thought it full of Idolatry, ſuperſtitions, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane traditions: becauſe I thought that Antichriſt did command and beare ſway in it: becauſe I thought the Catholikes did rely vpon their owne meritts, and not vpon the price of thy bloud. But what if the Diuells bewitching you, which now hath a poſſeſſion of your mind, ſhould then be taken away, &amp; you ſhould plainely ſee your ſelfe deceyued, what counſaile would you take? for then there will not be any more tyme for pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and repentance. Will you perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture alleadge ignorance? But that wil not excuſe you, becauſe you might eaſily haue knowne the truth, if you had vſed the diligence, that you were bound to do in ſo important a matter. Neyther e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wanted you iuſt reaſon of doubting, which ſhould haue moued you to ſeeke for reſolution. Wherefore as it ſhall not

For that you might without ſyn depart from the Catholike Church, it was your part not only to thinke, and vpon certaine light ſuſpitions to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue, but alſo moſt certainely to know, and ſetting aſide all affection to be moſt aſſured, that there were thoſe euills in the Catholike religion, ſo as there might be left no further ſcruple in your mind, nor any iuſt cauſe of doubting in the matter. But you were ſo far from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſuch a certitude touching the Churches errors, as you had not any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable reaſon to perſwade you to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. For by what probability, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of truth could you be perſuaded to thinke that, that religion was obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Idolatry, and to ſo great errors, which you ſaw imbraced for ſo many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, of ſo many men, renowned for their wiſdome, &amp; holynes of life? Which you ſaw honoured with ſuch, ſo great, and many miracles, &amp; martyrdomes? Which you ſaw ſpread all the world ouer? In which there was an exceeding conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:5297:109"/>and concord of the Doctors, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall ſucceſſion, and a moſt manifeſt and knowne continuance from the Apoſtles? How can it poſſibly be, that none of the Doctors, nor no holy man did for ſo many ages togeather note and obſerue this Idolatry, theſe ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and errors?</p>
                     <p>Againe, how could you perſwade your ſelfe that, that is Chriſts true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that maketh God the author, and mouer, yea compeller to all wickednes? that ſpoyleth men of the liberty of free will? that taketh away the care of exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of good works? that openeth a moſt wide gate to al manner of wickednes, as doth Atheiſme? that vnder ſhew of Chriſtian liberty, exempteth and freeth the ſubiects from the lawes and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their Princes, that reuiueth and bringeth many ancient and condemned hereſyes to light againe, the authors whereof be not recommended for any auſterity, conuerſation, or ſanctimony of life, nor celebrated for any miracles, but me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giuen to the pleaſures of the fleſh, couetous of things of the world, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, foule ſpoken, ſeditious, infamous

                     <p>Finally, if any of theſe new vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtart Religions be true, then there was not any religion of Chriſt for ſo many ages paſt: Chriſts Kingdome was ruyned and ouerthrowne: Gods promiſes tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſtability and continuance of his Church were made voide; the gates of hell preuayled againſt it. The Goſpell was then for ſo many hundreds of yeares preached in vaine: in vaine was it belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: in vaine were ſo many conuerted from paganiſme: in vaine were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, &amp; other Sacraments adminiſtred: in vaine were faſts kept, and mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the fleſh practiſed: in vaine were martyrdomes endured, and the bloud of ſo many thouſands ſhed for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſts name. Therefore all thoſe of our religion who are gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs, are periſhed, ſo many thouſands of martyrs &amp; Confeſſors, ſo many ſoules conſecrated to God, celebrated for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes, miracles, and the ſpirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy. For all of them had not any part of true religion in them, nor true iuſtice,

                     <p>But if all this be falſe, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and euen horrible to thinke, how could it be, that you could not think, that thoſe religions, out of which ſo horrible things are manifeſtly dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced might be falſe, or at leaſt that you doubted not of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?

                        <pb n="201" facs="tcp:5297:111"/>And in very deed Hereſy is a moſt grieuous ſyn. Firſt,
<note place="margin">How great a ſyn Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy is.</note> becauſe it is the cauſe, that a man preferreth his owne iudgment before that of all the Fathers, of all the Doctors of the Church, of all Councells, and of all the Biſhops of the whole world. For he contemneth them all, as men deſtitute and deuoid of Gods ſpirit, which he arrogateth to himſelfe alone, and to others his like: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a wonder it is, how great pride there is. Secondly, he cenſureth Chriſts Spouſe which is the Church, to haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted adultery with Sathan, &amp; to be the child of perdition. Thirdly, he chargeth it with the cryme of Idolatry, and with diuers ſuperſtitions. Fourthly, he caſteth forth many blaſphemies againſt the holy Euchariſt, and Gods Saints.

                     <p>Then ſhall they accurſe them, who deceiued them, and their maiſters by whome they were drawn and brought into that miſery. They ſhall accurſe the deuill who blinded their eyes, that they ſaw not the truth, and vnder a pretence of piety diuerſely bewitched them. They ſhall alſo accurſe themſelues for giuing eare vnto them, for ſo fooliſhly imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a new doctrine without diligently examining it before: and for hauing been ſo blind, negligent and ſlouthfull in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of a matter, that ſo neerely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned them.

For it ſeemeth a thing beyoud beliefe, that moſt holy and moſt learned men, ſuch as the Church euer had very many, did either not ſee this Idolatry, if there were any, or if they ſaw it did not onely not reiect it, but alſo did with all diligence retaine and imbrace it. This is a calumniation of old, both of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans, and of the Image-breakers.

                     <p>And now am I in the ſecond place briefly to admoniſh Catholiks, that they
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:5297:116"/>duly ponder with themſelues, how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding great a benefit this is of true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which hath by diuine fauour hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to them before infinite others, who are debarerd of it: and how much by occaſion of ye they be obliged and bound to the Diuine maieſty. This is the gift &amp; priuiledg but of a few, if we conſider the infinite number of ſuch as go aſtray, or ſtand in doubt, and therefore for this reſpect the more is it to be eſteemed. Let them thinke, that in humane things no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be compared with it, not pleaſures, nor honors, nor millions of gold and ſyluer, no not Scepters, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, or Empires. The margarite perle of true religion doth exceed all theſe by infinite degrees: and he that is poſſeſſed of it, though he want other things, and is moſt poore of al tertene things, is moſt truly rich, as beeing a cittizen with the Saints, the ſonne of God, an heyre of a Kingdome, and coheire with Chriſt, yet ſo as he muſt haue a will to lyue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably thereunto. He that wanteth it, is thrice miſerable indeed, though he otherwiſe abound in all the goods of this life, and hath them at his will.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="211" facs="tcp:5297:116"/>This is the moſt certaine and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to life euerlaſting, and none there is, who ſtrayeth out of it, that is not moſt aſſured to runne into euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting perdition. It is a Doctrine of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme, that euery one may be ſaued in his owne religion. But as there is one God, one Chriſt, one truth, one certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, one iuſtice: ſo there is one fayth, and one religion, and one Church or Congregation of God and Chriſt, out of which there can be no Saluation. Let them take heede, that they ſpoyle not themſelues of ſo great a good, eyther out of a curioſity of reading or hearing, or by an improuident and vncircumſpect conuerſation with heretiks, or out of a deſire of pleaſing, and contenting ſome, or for feare of ſome hurt in temporall life alſo, or out of an hope of commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and gaine, or for deſire of honors, or for any other cauſe. What profiteth it a man if he gayne the whole world, and ſuffer the detryment of his ſoule? or what exchaunge ſhall a man giue for his ſoule? But he, that ſuſtayneth hurt in his religion, cannot but hurt his ſoule withall: and therefore let him not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:5297:117"/>to expoſe all for the retayning of it, the looſing and forgoing whereof is the loſſe of life euerlaſting withall. Vnhappy be thoſe ſoules, and vnworthy a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian name, that make but a little recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the ouerthrow of the Catholike religion, ſo they may themſelues enioy temporall peace for the gathering and keeping of the poore things, and trifles of this life. This madnes, and light eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceme of ſo great a good, will coſt them deare, when this ſhort time &amp; moment of life ſhall be once paſt, and they ſhall vpon the ſuddaine be brought to that eternity, that neuer endeth.</p>
                     <p>Many ſeducers haue come into the world, many do vnder a ſheeps ſkyn, and vnder a faire &amp; flattering ſhew of Gods word hide and conceale their woluiſh fury, to the vtter ruine of Chriſts ſheep. Our Lord admoniſhed vs more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> once to take heed of them: the Apoſtles incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated no leſſe, as did the holy Fathers alſo: <hi>He,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Eccl.</hi> 13. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3.</note> that shall touch pitch, shall be defiled of it: he that loueth da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, shal perish therein.</hi> The times were neuer more trecherous to mans ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, then now they be: the deuill was neuer more frequent in bewitching and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:5297:117"/>deceiuing: men were neuer more eaſily caried away with the ſpirit of inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancy: the operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; working of errour neuer of more force: &amp; finally mens minds ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer more fouly blinded then now, &amp; all theſe do worthily ſeize vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their minds who do make a light eſteeme of that noble and great gift of the Catholike and Orthodoxe Religion, &amp; prefer their temporall and externall goods before it.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore let them, who make a reckoning of their owne ſaluation, conſerue this beauenly gemme, and keep it with all diligence, for that of it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth life.

                     <p>Finally this opinion maketh no difference betwixt Turciſme, Iudaiſme and Chriſtianiſme, but in ſome few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different matters, and nothing neceſſary vnto ſaluation; in ſo much that it is all one in what religion thou liueſt; ſeing that thou maiſt indifferently in all of them obtayne thy ſaluation; the which is nothingels, but to open the way to Alcoran, and to make Mahomet equall with Chriſt, or rather manifeſtly to bring in Atheiſme. For to approue euery Religion is to take away all Religion, and to thinke none neceſſary, ſeing that the true Religion can be but one.</p>
                     <p>The fundamentall reaſon wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon this opinion eſpecially relieth, is of no moment. For firſt, if it be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credable that God for the ſpace of ſome thouſands of yeares hath left the whole word in Idolatry, excepting only the Iewiſh nation being but a little portion or corner of the whole world, and to haue permitted it to be vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, albeit there were ſo many rare

                     <p>Laſtly, if there be any who haue hard nothing of Chriſtian Religion, or which do thinke that there is nothing wherby they may be iuſtly moued to any further inquiſition, thoſe men ſhall not be damned for the ſin of Infidelity, that is to ſay, becauſe they haue not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued in Chriſt, but for ſome other things, which they haue done agaynſt the law of nature, the which by help of God they might haue eſchewed: for God hath not left them ſo deſtitute of his prouidence and help, but that they

                     <p>Fifthly, it is a ſkornefull thing to ſay, that it is ſufficient for euery one to belieue the Creed according to their owne ſenſe and vnderſtanding therof, ſeing there is but one only truth, the which if we do not attayne, we belieue that which is falſe: but a falſe faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayleth nothing to ſaluation.

                     <p>Yf thou doeſt ſay, that the Creed muſt be belieued in a true ſenſe, then thou condemneſt all the Sects of this tyme, whereof there is none which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieueth all the articles of the Creed in the ſame ſenſe with Catholikes, or which doth not differ one from another in the explication of the Creed.

                     <p>But it is euident,

The article <hi>of iudging the quicke and the dead,</hi> the Catholikes do otherwiſe expound, who hold that God ſhall ſo iudge vs that he will reward our good workes with heauen, and puniſh our euill deeds with hell: otherwiſe the Caluiniſts, and Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans, who deny all reward to good workes, and that God only in his diuine
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:5297:130"/>iudgement will principally eſteeme, &amp; reward a ſpeciall fayth only. The aricle <hi>of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the Catholikes, and Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans do otherwiſe vnderſtand then the Arians, and many Caluiniſts. The article of the <hi>Church,</hi> the Lutherans and Caluiniſts do vnderſtand of the inuiſible congregation of thoſe which are prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate: the Catholikes do vnderſtand it of the viſible company of Catholiks, wherein many are predeſtinate, many are reprobate.

                     <p>The ſecond propoſition,
<note place="margin">The faith of all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth vpon a falſe gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und.</note> to wit, that all Sects are grounded vpon a falſe and deceitful foundation, I proue in this manner: for eyther they belieue their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions for the authority of their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Luther, Caluin, Melancthon, Zw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inglius &amp;c. whom they iudge to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed with the ſpirit of God, or becauſe euery one of them in their owne priuate iudgement do beleeue thoſe things to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyned in holy Scripture, or laſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their owne priuate ſpirit doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly teſtify vnto them, that thoſe things are true, or that this is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of holy Scripture: for whatſoeuer the ſects of theſe tymes do belieue, they are moued thereunto by one of theſe three reaſons, and they appoint one of them to be the foundation or reaſon of their beliefe: but theſe foundations, and reaſons be altogeather falſe and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="243" facs="tcp:5297:131"/>As for the firſt reaſon, to wit the authority of Luther, Caluin, and the reſt who firſt inuented theſe new Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, that it is deceitfull, is many feſt, becauſe we ſee by experience that both they might, and haue byn often decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, for they haue reuoked many things, corrected many things, and in many things haue they contradicted themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, as hath byn declared in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation of Religion in the 9. Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the ſixt Reaſon. Hence it commeth to paſſe that few now adayes will rely vpon their authority, becauſe they ſay, they were men, and therefore ſubiect to error, wherfore their follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers alſo do leaue them at their owne pleaſure, when they thinke they haue found any thing fitter for their purpoſe: their authority therfore is deceitfull, &amp; vncertayne, euen by the iudgement of their owne ſchollers, and followers.</p>
                     <p>Neyther is the other, to wit, the priuate iudgment, whereby they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the holy Scripture, leſſe deceitful: for many falſe thinges by that priuate iudgement ſeeme to be true, and many things which before ſeemed true are
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:5297:132"/>afterward iudged falſe. From hence ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſo great variety and inconſtancy in many of them concerning matters of faith, becauſe indeed mans iudgement is weake, eſpecially in the myſteries of our fayth, and the vnderſtanding of holy Scripture, the which far exceedeth the reach of mans wiſdome and reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Many do anſwere, that they do not rely vpon their iudgment in matters of faith, but vpon the holy Scriptures which cannot erre,
<note place="margin">Whether all ſecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do rely vpon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> wherin how miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably they are deceiued by this appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, becauſe almoſt all the ſects do ſay, that they rely vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> holy Scripture, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as notwithſtanding they differ among themſelues in moſt of the matters, one teaching contrary vnto another, the which could by no meanes come to paſſe, if they did not reſt vpon their owne iudgments, but vpon the lawfull and common vnderſtanding of the holy Scripture: for the holy Scripture is no where contrary vnto it ſelfe, neyther doth it any where diſagree from it ſelfe: that therefore they ſo greatly iarre &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree among themſelues, is cauſed, by that they make a ſenſe to the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:5297:132"/>according to their owne priuate iudgment, the which is diuerſly framed by them, according to the diuerſity of iudgments and vnderſtanding among them: they rely therfore vpon the holy Scripture, not as it is interpreted by the Catholike Church &amp; the holy Fathers, but as they in their priuate iudgment do interprete it: for the vertue and force of the holy Scripture doth not only conſiſt in the bare words, but in the ſenſe and meaning therof: but the priuate iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inuenteth this ſenſe, and ioyneth it to the words of the Scripture as lyfe vnto the body: the whole reaſon of their fayth therefore is their priuate iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the which how deceitfull oftentymes it is, may eaſily be declared by the diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſo many ſects. For it is all one whether thou ſaiſt, that thou relieſt v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Scripture as it is interpreted by thy proper iudgment, or that thou relieſt v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon thy owne iudgment preciſely in it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Finally, the third reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon many now adayes do rely, is moſt deceitfull and skornfull of all, a manifeſt ſigne wherof is that among the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:5297:133"/>who aboue all others are guyded by the inſtinct of the ſpirit, there is the greateſt variety of ſects, and diſagrement of faith, the which could not be, but that the ſpirit whereupon they rely, and by whome they are gouerned is deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and variable. The ſame alſo is to be ſeene among Caluiniſts, and Lutherans, and amongſt their ſects and diuers facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for their owne opinion is certayne and euident vnto euery one of them by the teſtimony of their owne priuate iudgment, the which inwardly teacheth euery one of them and affoardeth the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of truth vnto euery one of them, whereby it is manifeſt that this ſpirit is not the holy Ghoſt, the ſpirit of truth, who cannot teach contraryes, or be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite vnto it ſelfe, but it is a wicked ſpirit, the ſpirit of error, who is a lyar from the begining, and the father of lyes, who worketh in the children of incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity, of whome the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue not receiued the charity of truth,
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 6.</note> he will therefore ſend them the operation of error, that they may belieue in lyes.</hi> And in another place.

                        <hi>Do not belieue euery ſpirit but try their ſpirits, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be of God or not. For many falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are gone out into the world.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This therefore is the ſpirit which beareth rule in the harts of heretiks, whoſe teſtimony &amp; operation they feele inwardly engrafted in their harts, and yet they thinke it to be the worke of the holy Ghoſt, who ſo blindeth their mind, and fanſies, that they iudge light to be darkneſſe, and darkneſſe light, that they think the moſt cleare truth of the Catholike faith to be an error, and moſt filthy errors to be the cleare truth. And truly if they were not wholy blinded &amp; bewitched, they might eaſily perceiue that ſpirit whome they feele inwardly, not to be the ſpirit of God, or at the leaſt they might begin to doubt therof, ſeing that all ſects among whome there is ſo great diſſention &amp; variety of opinions, do all equally feele, boaſt of, and follow that teſtimony of this ſpirit, and rely v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it in the confirmation of their moſt contrary opinions: but this hapneth by the iuſt iudgment of God: for as the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:5297:134"/>Iewes who would not receiue Chriſt were permitted to be blinded by the diuell, as it is manifeſt by the Apoſt. 2. <hi>ad Theſ.</hi> 2. ſo heretiks becauſe they haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the Catholik fayth (the which is no leſſe a fault then that of the Iewes) are deliuered vnto him, that he may as it were bewitch their minds, and driue them into all kind of error.</p>
                     <p>But if any will attentiuely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he ſhall eaſily preceyue a more potent operation of the diuell and bewitching of mindes in our Heretiks,
<note place="margin">The diuell doth ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiks then Iewes.</note> then eyther in Iewes or Mahometans, and that for two reaſons. Firſt becauſe the Iews agree in the ſame faith, neither is there any variety of ſects among them: among the Mahomets there are only two ſects, and there is no great difference betwixt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But among heretiks of theſe tymes there are many ſects, ſome ariſing by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of new opinions, who condemne one another of hereſy, and all theſe are riſen within the ſpace of 90. yeares, the which is a manifeſt ſigne, that the diuell meruailouſly poſſeſſeth inwardly the hartes of theſe men, troubling their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, peruerting their imaginations and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:5297:134"/>iudgments, that they cannot remayne or be quiet any where.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe the common ſort of people among the Iewes and Turkes do not rely vpon their owne iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gment, or vpon the teſtimony and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of the priuate ſpirit, but vpon the iudgment of their doctors, or (which is all one) vpon their owne Scripture, as it is interpreted vnto them by the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of their Religion; they haue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the rule of their faith and ground of their beliefe conformable as it were to reaſon, that is to ſay, the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of their predeceſſors, or the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture explicated vnto them by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the doctors of their Religion. But moſt of the heretikes of theſe tymes do not reſpect their Superiors and Apoſtles from whom they firſt receiued this new Ghoſpell, but they forſake them as men ſubiect to error, and they rely wholy vpon their owne iudgment, or vpon the teſtimony of the priuat ſpirit, or which is al one, vpon the Scripture only, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood after the ſenſe of their owne iudgment &amp; priuate ſpirit, the which is an euident ſign, that Sathan doth ſo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:5297:135"/>worke in them &amp; bewitch their myndes, that not only euery one fey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gneth vnto himſelfe new hereſies and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, but alſo that he placeth the foundation of his beliefe &amp; rule of faith in himſelf, &amp; in his owne inward ſenſe and iudgement: for euery one thinketh himſelf to be taught by our Lord and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the Magiſtery of the ſpirit, albeit they be women &amp; yong girles, &amp; therfore to be free from error; but al the holy Fathers to haue byn men ſubiect to error. The ſame they iudge of their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Miniſters. But what greater bewitching or deceiuing of people can there be, then this? Hence it commeth to paſſe that they haue no certaine and eſtabliſhed opinions amongſt them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they ſet downe or frame any body of doctrine and religion, but they muſt wander vp and downe in vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintyes, as the priuate ſpirit leadeth them; neyther can there any diſputation be made with them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, ſeing that they do not defend any one opinion, they being by reaſon of the ignorance of their predeceſſors alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather vnlearned.

                     <p>By theſe it is manifeſtly concluded that all the ground and foundation of faith wherupon the ſects of our tymes relye, is falſe and vncertaine, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their faith which relyeth theron is vnprofitable, and auayleth nothing to ſaluation.</p>
